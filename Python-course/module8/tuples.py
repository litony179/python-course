# In this file, we are going to talk about the Python Tuple 
# ===================================================================================================================
# A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a set of parenthesis ().
# The Tuple object in Python is similar to a list.
# The difference is that Python tuples is immutable meaning that the elements inside a tuple cannot be changed.
#  As an example

users = ('ali', 'Tony', 'Whitney', 'admin', 'public')
print(type(users))

print(users.index('ali'))
